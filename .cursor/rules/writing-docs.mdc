# Writing Documentation Guidelines

## Core Principles
- Write concisely and purposefully - every word must earn its place
- Ensure logical flow between sentences and sections
- Build information progressively from fundamentals to advanced concepts
- Use active voice and present tense
- Include practical, production-ready examples

## Document Structure

1. Overview (What & Why)
   - One-sentence description
   - Purpose and value proposition
   - Target audience and prerequisites

2. Main Content
   - Present information in logical sequence
   - Use clear, hierarchical headings
   - Include relevant code examples
   - Break down complex concepts with diagrams or analogies
   - Structure processes as numbered steps

3. Summary
   - Key takeaways
   - Common pitfalls and solutions
   - Related resources

## Technical Standards
- All code examples must:
  - Follow language-specific style guides and conventions
  - Include error handling and input validation
  - Be security-conscious and production-ready
  - Use current best practices and modern syntax
  - Be properly typed and documented
- Include version requirements and dependencies
- Highlight performance considerations
- Note any platform-specific requirements

## Writing Style
- Use short, declarative sentences
- Define technical terms on first use
- Format code, commands, and paths with backticks
- Structure content with consistent heading hierarchy
- Use lists for related items, tables for comparisons
