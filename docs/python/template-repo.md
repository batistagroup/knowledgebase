# Python Project Template

Setting proper project structure, configuring `pyproject.toml`, writing [pre-commit config](../git/pre-commit.md), configuring [github workflows](../git/github-workflows.md) is quite time consuming, but most importantly pretty much doesn't change from one project to another.

Which is why we created a boilerplate [python template](https://github.com/batistagroup/python-template) that is already configured with many best practices in mind.
